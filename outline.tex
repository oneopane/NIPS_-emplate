        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Introduction
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Introduction to general field
            \item Explanation of high level problem and whats lacking 
                \subitem RelateRelate whats lacking to how you are going to solve the problem
            \item General Overview of similar work
                \subitem Make sure to specifically talk about problems with previous work if your reseach solves that problem
            \item High Level overview of proposed Idea
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item Preliminaries/Background
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Introduce General Framework that Problem is being solved on
            \item Introduce other relevant ideas
                \subitem I.e stuff from unrelated topics if you are using it to solve problem
                \subitem Example: If you are talking about RL and use MMD to solve problem, need to go over MMD
            \end{itemize}
            
            
        \item Ideas/Theory
            \begin{itemize}
                \item High Level/Intruitive Explanation of paragrah (1-2[MAX!!] paragraphs)
                \item Walk through idea in framework of Intuitive Explanation 
                \item Put proofs here if necessary (ΤΗΕ ΜΟRE PROOFS THE BETTER!!!)
            \end{itemize}
    
        \item Experiments
            \begin{itemize}
            \item NOTE: Try to order experiments in a manner that flows with the above story
            \end{itemize}
    
        \item Conclusion
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Give brief review of problem solved
            \item Breifly talk about shortcomings/possible directions
            \item End with argument about how people should care about this and why its exciting
            \end{itemize}
